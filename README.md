# AI Companion

## Overview
AI Companion is a multi-modal assistant that combines a chatbot (LLM with RAG) and a Vision module for real-time object detection and contextual interactions. The system is built with Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, YOLOv8, and Streamlit.

## My Contributions
- Implemented the Vision module using YOLOv8 and OpenCV for real-time image detection and contextual feedback.  
- Assisted in integrating RAG-based retrieval with LangChain for enhanced chatbot responses.  
- Contributed to testing and debugging of multi-modal features to ensure smooth interaction between Vision and Chat components.
